Leaf_blight,"1. In new plantings, growers might consider grouping together certain disease-susceptible varieties in the vineyard, so they can spray only the blocks that need it.
2. If disease pressure is mounting during a wet spring, growers shouldn�t wait too long to get a fungicide applied, even if that means a rain may wash some off.
3. Protectants such as mancozeb and ziram can provide economical early-season control, especially for Phomopsis and black rot, and sulfur may be used for early powdery mildew control in cultivars that are not sulfur-sensitive.",https://www.goodfruit.com/11-tips-to-beat-grape-fungal-diseases/

Bacterial_spot,"1. The most effective management strategy is the use of pathogen-free certified seeds and disease-free transplants to prevent introduction of the pathogen into greenhouses and field production areas.
2. Transplants should be inspected regularly to identify symptomatic seedlings. Transplants with symptoms may be removed and destroyed or treated with streptomycin, if detected at the very early stage of disease development.
3. Washing seeds for 40 minutes in diluted Clorox (two parts Clorox plus eight parts water) is effective in reducing the bacterial population on a seed�s surface.","https://extension.wvu.edu/lawn-gardening-pests/plant-disease/fruit-vegetable-diseases/bacterial-leaf-spot-of-pepper#:~:text=Bacterial%20leaf%20spot%2C%20caused%20by,to%20another%20(Frank%20et%20al."

Leaf_scorch,"1. Since this fungal pathogen overwinters on the fallen leaves of infected plants, proper garden sanitation is key. This includes the removal of infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants.
2. The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection.
3. When making new plantings always ensure that good planting practices are implemented. These practices include the use of proper plant spacing to provide adequate air circulation and the use of drip irrigation.","https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/fruits/strawberry/strawberries-with-leaf-scorch.htm#:~:text=Scorched%20strawberry%20leaves%20are%20caused,on%20the%20topside%20of%20leaves."

2. Nightshade and horsenettle are frequently hosts of Septoria leaf spot and should be eradicated around the garden site.
3. If the above measures do not control the disease, you may want to use fungicidal sprays. Fungicides will not cure infected leaves, but they will protect new leaves from becoming infected.",https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/fungal-spots/septoria-leaf-spot-of-tomato.aspx
Spider_mites,"1. Spray water regularly on plants to reduce dust, spider mites do well in dusty conditions.
2. Remove remains (residues) from a previous crop and destroy before planting new crop.
3. Avoid continuous cropping of tomato and related plants which makes it difficult to control red spider mites, since they always have a plant to feed on.","https://www.plantwise.org/knowledgebank/factsheetforfarmers/20137804187#:~:text=The%20tomato%20red%20spider%20mites,and%20die%20or%20fall%20off."
Target_Spot,"1. Rotate crops and don�t plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year� primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course� tomatoes.
2. Be sure the plants aren�t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil.
3. Water tomato plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry. Water at the base of the plant or use a soaker hose or drip system to keep the leaves dry. Apply a mulch to keep the fruit from coming in direct contact with the soil.","https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/target-spot-on-tomatoes.htm#:~:text=Also%20known%20as%20early%20blight,passion%20flower%20and%20certain%20ornamentals."
